# FIFA Data analysis

### performing EDA
###### I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a FIFA dataset using pandas and matplotlib to gain a deeper understanding of the data. Key steps included identifying the top 5 nationalities represented by FIFA players and visualizing the data with a bar chart. I also analyzed the top 5 highest-paid players and created a corresponding bar chart. Additionally, I filtered players from Germany, sorting them by height, weight, and salary. Further analysis included identifying the top 5 players based on shooting and defending rates, as well as the top 5 players by salary. Lastly, I determined the nationalities of Real Madrid players throughout the dataset.
